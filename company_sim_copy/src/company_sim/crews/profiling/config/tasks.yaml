  description: >
    Read the latest Discord chat messages using the read_discord_messages tool.
    Analyze each dicord chat user's communication patterns, personality traits, technical skills,
    interests, emotional state, and behavioral patterns.
    Create a detailed psychological and behavioral profile for each user.
    
    Your analysis should include:
    - Communication style (formal/informal, verbose/concise, technical/casual)
    - Personality indicators (introvert/extrovert, analytical/creative, etc.)
    - Technical competence level and areas of expertise
    - Interests and topics they engage with
    - Emotional patterns and stress indicators
    - Social dynamics and relationship with other users
    - Timing patterns (when they are most active)
    - Language patterns and vocabulary used
    
    DO NOT post anything to Discord. This is purely analytical work.
    Your output will be a comprehensive report, not a message.
